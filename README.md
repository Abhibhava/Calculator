# Calculator

This code containes two types of html and js enteries.
This is because i have used two different methods to calculate it. The commented code calculates using onclick(), where i have specified different functions and have written those functions in javascript.

The other un-commented code is from a source, where we are using EVENTLISTENERS for click.
